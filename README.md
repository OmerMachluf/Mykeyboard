# Release
* Every commit to _master_ branch will deploy a new release to the _ALPHA_ channel in Google Play-Store. You can subscribe to this release channel by joining the [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/106050362696748221135) group, and opt-in by visiting [this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard).
* Every once in a while, a stable enough _ALPHA_ will be promoted to _BETA_. You can opt-in to this channel by visiting [this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard).
* Once all requirements for a release were finished, a _STABLE_ [release branch](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard/tree/release-branch) will be cut. Every commit to this branch will be automatically published to Google Play Store, and will roll-out users gradually.

Note: _ALPHA_ and _BETA_ releases include the _Internet_ permission so we can follow crashes and usage. _STABLE_ release does not include the _Internet_ permission.
